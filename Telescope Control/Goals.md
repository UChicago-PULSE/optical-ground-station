These are the goals for telescope control for the Spring of the 2024-2025 school year:
  - Integrate the tracking camera
  - Telescope pointing calibration (in prog)
  - Tracking ISS: The main goal is to at the very least be ready to track the ISS with the tracking camera by the end of the quarter.
