"""
The purpose of this code is to connect to a ZWO ASI camera.

This code was compiled by Ashley Ashiku, telescope engineer, for the PULSE-A project. This code utilizes Python wrappers written by Steve Marple, 2017 
(search python-zwoasi on GitHub) around C commands for ZWO ASI cameras from the software development kit.
